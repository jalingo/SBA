/**
    An enumeration of the criteria for which a USER has flagged tip.

    - Off Topic: Said tip is not actually small business advice, but instead concerns something besides small business advice.
    - Inaccurate: Said tip contains, relies on or expounds false information.
    - Duplicate: Said tip is already better represented by another tip, or presents an existing tip redundantly.
    - Wrong Category: Said tip has been mis-categorized.
    - Spam: Said tip's purpose is to advertise or solicit, rather than actually profer advice.
    - Abusive / Obscene: Said tip contains NSFW content, or its purpose is to generate controversy, cause harm or be pornographic.
